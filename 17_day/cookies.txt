Tracking Activity: Cookies can track your activity on a website, like what pages you visit and what items you add to your cart. This helps websites improve user experience and offer personalized content.

Maintaining Sessions: Cookies keep you logged in while you browse different pages on a site, making sure you don’t have to log in again on each new page.

Analytics: Websites use cookies to collect data about how users interact with the site, which helps them analyze and improve their services.

The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie.


There are two Web Storage objects:
sessionStorage
localStorage

localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed.

storage objects created in Firefox cannot be accessed in Internet Explorer, exactly like cookies.
